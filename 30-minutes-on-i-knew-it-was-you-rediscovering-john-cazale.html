So many biographies of actors, whether legendary or (like Cazale) more cultish, tend to slide into meaningless superlatives, platitudes, and acting-class philosophizing, none of which means anything to anyone who isn't already an&nbsp;actor. That's not the case here. This movie takes you inside the process, inside the craft, the job, and shows that it's about bravery, knowledge, skill, and choices.&nbsp;</p><p>A constant refrain is&nbsp;Cazale's&nbsp;willingness to be transparent and take the audience inside of his characters' hurt, without doing anything that might subliminally reassure viewers that the actor is cooler and more confident than the person he's playing. We see Cazale doing that in film after film, to the point where it becomes undeniable that this is not just a thing he did to stand out, but part of a larger philosophy about what good acting was, and how it could connect&nbsp;emotionally and intellectually&nbsp;with audiences.</p><p>Shepard has spent much of&nbsp;his career directing actors in tonally specific projects, in which a single misplaced bit of body language or dropped syllable might ruin the intent of an exchange. He brings that practical knowledge to bear, seemingly&nbsp;going out of his way to ask for observable examples every time he's interviewing performers about what made Cazale special. Without fail, his subjects&nbsp;deliver, often in the manner of the sorts of schoolteachers we remember fondly because they never talked down to us.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmprKjZIBxecyipa6slah6sLqMomSkppWseqrAjLCYrGWppMJuvsSdoKybn6uys7XNoGSjp5ijeqSt2Zqjng%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
