Despite the white cast members, there are a few minority stars in the film, including Zoe Saldaña and Cliff Curtis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>On Dec. 18, Begay asked her Twitter followers to boycott&nbsp;Avatar: The Way of Water&nbsp;because she claimed that the movie and Cameron tried “satisfy some white man’s savior complex.” However, history shows that Lakota people being forced to leave their homes and many getting killed by U.S. soldiers as a way to prevent religious movement, among many reasons.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Do NOT watch Avatar: The Way of Water</p><p>Join Natives & other Indigenous groups around the world in boycotting this horrible & racist film.

Cameron’s comments were problematic because he stated that the Lakota people would have fought harder if they could have foreseen that their children were “committing suicide” at a high rate. He said,</p><p>“I felt like I was 130 years back in time watching what the Lakota Sioux might have been saying at a point when they were being pushed and they were being killed and they were being asked to displace and they were being given some form of compensation… This was a driving force for me in the writing of ‘Avatar’ — I couldn’t help but think that if they [the Lakota Sioux] had had a time-window and they could see the future … and they could see their kids committing suicide at the highest suicide rates in the nation … because they were hopeless and they were a dead-end society — which is what is happening now — they would have fought a lot harder.”</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>As Cameron’s past remarks began circulating online, other Native Americans and Indigenous Twitter users expressed their honest opinions and why they no longer support the&nbsp;Avatar&nbsp;franchise.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>One person stated, “Avatar&nbsp;is canceled” because of Cameron’s resurfaced comments and how wrong the 68-year-old was for saying that Lakota people should have fought harder.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Don't watch that movie.

She&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>, “I do unfortunately need to loudly bitch AGAIN about the paradox that Native ppl in the entertainment industry face *to this day* compared to “well-meaning” white EPs. Despite producing LAUDED Native-led content in 2021-22, we continue to see whites capitalizing on our stories!”</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>To prove her point that this has been an issue in Hollywood for years, Schmieding also shared the 2020 Open Letter to Hollywood, written by “28 members of the Native American and Indigenous Writers Committee,” which showcases that they want their stories to be told by their people. Schmieding wrapped up the tweet by saying she doesn’t care if she gets canceled for speaking up because this issue needs to be appropriately addressed.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>Despite the boycott,&nbsp;&nbsp;Avatar: The Way of Water&nbsp;has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">grossed $435 million worldwide</a> since its release on Dec. 16.
