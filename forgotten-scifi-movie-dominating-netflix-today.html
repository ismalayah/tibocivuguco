Nick Robinson (Jurassic World) also features as Ben, Cassie’s love interest, as does Ron Livingston (The Conjuring) as her dad and Liev Schreiber as the villainous Colonel Vosch.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Cassie-and-Evan-in-The-5th-Wave.jpg alt="The 5th Wave" width=1400 height=806 sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>Let’s not beat around the bush.&nbsp;The 5th Wave&nbsp;has been forgotten in the years since its release as it was a huge flop for Sony, who were clearly hoping to have a Hunger Game-type hit on their hands. On the back of a mid-level budget that ranged from $38-54 million, the film made only $109.9 million at the global box office. Combined with that, it was faced with harsh reviews and on Rotten Tomatoes, it sports an embarrassingly low score of just 15%.</p><p data-characters=615 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=false>“With unimpressive effects and plot points seemingly pieced together from previous dystopian&nbsp;YA&nbsp;sci-fi films,&nbsp;<i>The 5th Wave</i> ends up feeling like more of a limp, derivative wriggle,” is how RT’s Critics Consensus scathingly puts it. But, as we’ve seen many times before, what sunk in theaters often enjoys renewed success on <strong>Netflix</strong> as folks are less demanding with their time when they’re on their own couch. And in this case, it seems subscribers are happy to give over a couple of hours to The 5th Wave. Whether they end up enjoying it or not, though, is another question entirely.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonaiql6TBtbHNZqqcoZaeeq671aKcZpyforavrdOipaBlnprBp7jIsWStp5SWxnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
