She may not be the main character of the movie, but oftentimes it is the supporting roles like Mo’at’s that shape a film, and it’s not an over-exaggeration to say the role would suffer greatly were it not for the actress who brought her to life.</p><h2 id=h-who-plays-mo-at-in-the-films data-injectable=false>Who plays Mo’at in the films?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/C.C.H-Pounder.jpg><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true>The actress who played Mo’at in Avatar, and who will play her once more in The Way of Water, is none other than longtime Hollywood veteran <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">C.C.H. Pounder</a></strong>.</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>Pounder, 69, whose full name is Carol Christine Hilaria Pounder, is known most recently for her work as Dr. Loretta Wade in NCIS: New Orleans, which she was a part of for all seven seasons until the show ended in 2021. Before that, she’d appeared in countless movies and TV shows like The Shield and ER, dating all the way back to 1979 when she played Nurse Blake in All That Jazz.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>Since her time on Avatar in 2009, Pounder has lent her recognizable voice to numerous animated projects including the Batman: Arkham video game series, and has appeared on TV shows and films like Sons of Anarchy and Godzilla: King of the Monsters.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>Indeed, Pounder’s filmography knows no bounds, weaving in and out of various genres. So, too, do her personal interests. Not only is she a prolific actress, but she is also a respected art collector and restorer of homes.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>Pounder’s character of Mo’at in Avatar garnered much less attention that the film’s two main leads Saldaña and Worthington, but that’s perfectly fine with her. In fact, it’s almost preferred that most people don’t realize she starred in one of the biggest movies in cinema history.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>“For an actor, it’s one of the best places to ever find yourself,” she said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MovieWeb</a> back in 2010. “You can have conversations about the film, and you don’t have the ego to point out, ‘I played that role over there!’ It hasn’t bothered me at all.”</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=false>Pounder will once again reprise her role as the spiritual leader of the Omaticaya clan in Avatar: The Way of Water, which premiered in theaters all around the world on Friday, Dec. 16.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomK%2BZpJa%2FbsDHnmSwmalivKd51pqrnqpdrLWwec%2BlmLKrXaK8osCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
