As it turns out, Kaluuya shares a real-life connection with the web-slinging superhero, one which he calls “cool as f**k.”</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>Kaluuya explained that he was “gassed” to find out he landed the role, recalling to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Empire Magazine</a> how he thanked writers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, as well as director Kemp Powers, for giving him the part, if for no other reason than allowing him to finally act in his native tongue.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was gassed. I turned to Lord, Miller and Kemp and said, ‘Thank you for letting me be a part of it, because this is cool as fuck.’ I’m a voice in Spider-Verse with a wicked character that sounds exactly like me, from where I’m from. Come on! You go to the younger people in your family and flex: ‘I’m getting on, but don’t forget!’”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>As he explains it, Kaluuya was “born and bred” in Camden, meaning he’s well-versed in the punk movement that so heavily influences his character’s personality, not to mention all the “London-isms” that come so naturally to him. The experience left him feeling “really respected” as an actor because he was able to bring more to the table than just a voice for lines.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m Camden born and bred, and this character is from Camden which is very much associated with the punk movement, so I think they wanted to lean into what they have for free with me. They were like, ‘What do they speak like?’ and I said, ‘Like me!’ I think it gives it that authenticity, like me saying, ‘Man like Pav! [Indian Spider-Man Pavitr Prabhakar] Big steppa!’ I felt really respected.”</p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is touted as having just as much heart, if not more, than its predecessor, and not only because it involves a love story between Miles and Gwen Stacey. When the pair finally reconnect, it’ll be after Gwen has spent a significant amount of time with Kaluuya’s Spider-Punk. According to Empire Magazine, “There’s jealousy there,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and even a little bit of a love triangle</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>Fans won’t have to wait much longer to see Kaluuya in action. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is scheduled to premiere in theaters on June 2.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomaWZk6B6sa3NrZ%2Beql2owaK%2BjKCsrKCVqHqwwsSrZKGho2K7psOMrKeinJWneq6tzWaYnKqfqMBuwMeeZKyomZmys3nVnqmsnV2nvK2xjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
