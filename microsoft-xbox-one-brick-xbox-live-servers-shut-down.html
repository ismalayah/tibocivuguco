As described by Microsoft, the next-gen system can stay offline for a maximum of 24 hours, at which point it will attempt to contact the servers. If the servers can not be reached at that time, the console will basically lock up and only allow users to watch live TV or Blu-Ray discs. All other features (including the ability to play offline single-player games) will cease to work until the server connection is reestablished. Naturally, this required Internet connection raised questions about what will happen when Microsoft eventually shuts down the Xbox One servers at the end of this generation.</p><p data-characters=81 data-current-count=81 data-injectable=false>To answer that very question, Major Nelson stated the following in the interview:</p><p>“I’ll just say this: We haven’t even started this generation, so it’s kind of early to talk about the end of the generation. That’s certainly something we would not do. That’s not the way the system is designed. It’s designed for flexibility. But let’s get the system out there first.”</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>On the surface, Major Nelson’s response appears to be good news for the Xbox One and all its software, but ultimately it raises more questions/concerns than it answers.</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true>For starters, it is a bit of a stretch to say that Microsoft has not designed the Xbox One system to encounter problems when they eventually shut down their servers. As stated in their own <a href=#>literature</a>, the console requires a connection to the Xbox Live server. If the servers are not there to ping, then the system will not function. In this respect, they have absolutely designed the system to someday have a fatal flaw.</p><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>With this in mind, it appears that Major Nelson is hinting that the system is “flexible” enough for them to eventually remove the check-in requirement on the Xbox One, so that it can someday be played offline. If this is the case, and we certainly hope it is, why are they forcing the requirement in the first place? Why not just let users authenticate the license for their game offline by putting the game disc into the console?</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>Despite what Major Nelson says, I do not think it is too early for customers to question the long-term plans for the Xbox One. Speaking as someone who has accumulated a decent sized video game collection dating back to the original Intellivision, the ability to use a console long after its generation ends is extremely important to me, and something that I take into consideration before making a purchase.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>Sorry Microsoft, but a “don’t worry about it” answer is not going to cut it. The <strong>Xbox One</strong> has been designed to stop working when not connected to the Xbox Live servers. How exactly will this be changed when those servers no longer exist?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZopKKboqTAsLLTZq%2Bbp6hivK%2BxjJupopubYsWju9dmo6KulWLApr7VnqmsZaOdwrV5w6iup2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
