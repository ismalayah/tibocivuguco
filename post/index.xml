But other people have other plans, and the hero is swept along by the tide. This is, of course, the classic definition of film noir, those 1940s thrillers in which ordinary people discovered the evil that lurked beneath the surface of society, and “D.O.A.” itself is inspired by a 1949 thriller starring Edmund O’Brien.</description></item><item><title>Lucasfilm Reportedly Developing Star Wars Movie About The Very First Jedi</title><link>/lucasfilm-reportedly-developing-star-wars-movie-jedi.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/lucasfilm-reportedly-developing-star-wars-movie-jedi.html</guid><description>The canonical origins of the Jedi have always been shrouded in mystery, even as the expanded Star Wars universe has filled in countless gaps in the mythology through novels, comic books and video games.
