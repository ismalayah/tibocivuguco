But we hardly mind. The movie's method is to compare the uncomplicated love of the newlyweds with all of the compromises and deceptions, some loving, some otherwise, of everyone else in the story. This might have been an opening for a good deal of cynicism, but the movie is optimistic at heart. Not optimistic that love can survive unchanged throughout a lifetime, but that love and lovers can occasionally reach an accommodation that is not positively painful.</p><p>Of all the couples in the film, my favorites are the Italian parents, played by <a href=#>Richard Castellano</a> and <a href=#>Bea Arthur</a>. Both secretly believe they might have made more fortunate marriages, but in fact their marriage itself seems as substantial as Gibraltar. They have simplified their relationship to a sturdy respect for eating (especially of pasta and minestrone), an unshakable faith in the duty of parents to be the heads of families and a belief that their older son should not, under pain of death, get divorced.</p><p>But are they happy, their younger son asks. "Of course not," Castellano says. "Certainly not," says Miss Arthur. "But we're together. What's happy? We're together, that's what counts." Castellano, who is a large man with equal parts of machismo and jollity, very nearly steals the film with his performance as the father. He wants to know what's up.</p><p>"So, ah, what's the story, Richie?" he asks over and over, trying to extract the reasons for a divorce from his oldest. Finally, at the wedding dinner, puffing on a Camel in comradeship with his son, he manages to cut through his tough shyness and make contact. The movie makes contact in much the same way. It has the tact to hold back, to trust its characters to somehow fumble through to something that's not love, maybe, but will do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46lpq%2Bdoqh6orrDZqatoJWnerTA0ZqloJ2iqHpyhZZp</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
