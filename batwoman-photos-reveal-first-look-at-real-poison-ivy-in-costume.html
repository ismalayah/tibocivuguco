The first half of season 3 saw Mary Hamilton (Nicole Kang) scratched by one of Poison Ivy’s vines and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">transform into a new iteration</a> of the flora-loving femme fatale. But in this Wednesday’s midseason opener, we’ll finally get to meet the original Ivy, Pamela Isley, as played by Bridget Regan.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=491 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>And these new promo images for the episode reveal our first look at Pamela’s costume. The photos, as revealed by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV Line</a>, showcase Regan (Jane the Virgin, Agent Carter) in an outfit that’s highly reminiscent of Ivy’s look in the Arkham video games. Regan explained to TV Line that she had a specific idea for how she wanted her character to appear. “I wanted long hair, long nails, long lashes just like she’s growing —&nbsp;she is a plant,”&nbsp;the actress said.</p><p data-characters=164 data-current-count=164 data-injectable=false>Ivy will be revealed via flashbacks that see Renee Montoya (Victoria Catagena) open up about her past relationship with the supervillain.

I was drawn to this metamorphosis that she’s gone through — her extreme commitment to that mission, how radicalized she is, how passionate she is.”</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>That said, Regan teased that, despite her general hatred for humanity, her romance with Renee causes some emotional turmoil for Ivy as she’ll get to explore a “real internal conflict with her love life.”</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>Meanwhile, in the present-day storyline, Mary’s Ivy is “in full force this episode”, Kang previewed to TV Line. “It is the beginning of where the road diverges [from] ‘Poor Mary’ to ‘Oh, no! What are you doing? What are you becoming?’” she teased. She went on to stress that if Mary is ever to renounce her newfound evil ways she will have to “reckon with all of the wreckage that she’s created.”</p><p data-characters=97 data-current-count=97 data-injectable=false>Batwoman returns with episode 3×08 “Trust Destiny” tonight, Jan. 12, on The CW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yjrdOwpqaZnmK9qbvTqKpmqpWrsqK4jJ%2Bgq6ukYrmwu8pmmK1lopqurXnPqKCsp55itrfFjKKlZpufqMG2ucRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
