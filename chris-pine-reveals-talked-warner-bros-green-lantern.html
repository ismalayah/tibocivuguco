While some said Wonder Woman‘s Steve Trevor (which obviously ended up being the case), other sites pointed to the Star Trek actor showing up in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice as the new <a href=#><strong>Green Lantern</strong></a>.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true>The character isn’t actually expected to show up in these movies until the end of the first Justice League&nbsp;film, before starring in his own reboot in 2020. But, is there any truth at all to the stories claiming that Pine was talking to the studio about taking on the role of Hal Jordan?</p><p>“No. I was not offered Green Lantern ever, I’ve never had a conversation about Green Lantern,” said Pine.</p><p data-characters=64 data-current-count=64 data-injectable=false>Well, you can’t get much more definitive than that, right?</p><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=559 data-injectable=false>Despite the fact that he was clearly never up for the role of Green Lantern then, Pine’s part in Wonder Woman does remain something of a mystery. It’s not clear if he’s going to be starring as only the World War I version of Steve Trevor or as both him and his present day counterpart (presumably Trevor’s grandson). We likely won’t find that out for a while, but in the meantime, tell us, are you disappointed that Pine didn’t land the role of <strong>Green Lantern</strong>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomqGqmah6sbXNnmSrnaaarq2%2FjK2YpaOVmXq4rdGnnKtlkqe8tHnGq5yepl2hrq%2FAxKulaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
