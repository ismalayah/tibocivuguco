I'm sticking with my Mesozoic theory for now because I think that would be way cooler.</p><br>I know skepticism about these things is kinda my "brand," but I gotta' be honest, I was never particularly convinced by the "Ages" theory about the Regis.<p>Like, supposedly you have the Stone Age and the Iron Age, but then instead of the Bronze Age in between them (which is how that whole arc of history is typically broken down), you throw in the "Ice Age," even though unlike Stone/Bronze/Iron, the "Ice Age" isn't so much a specific epoch of human development, and is instead a recurring natural phenomenon. Overall it kind of feels like the whole thing must have started when someone who didn't know what they were talking about and was only loosely familiar with these terms through pop culture tried to come up with a "theme" after reading Regice's Dex entry say "ice age." Then trying to find more periods that we've happened to refer to as "Ages," even if they all come from unrelated systems and perspectives on history, to apply to Regieleki and Regidrago just feels like even more of a stretch to me.</p><p>I find it especially odd when considering that the Regis were seemingly all created at the same time? Regice's body is made of ice from an ice age, yes, but that doesn't mean Regigigas couldn't have obtained the rock and the magma that it needed for the other two elsewhere. I've always imagined them to be contemporaries.</p><p>Has anyone else noticed how in the Crown Tundra, these Pokemon are referred to as legendary giants, not titans like they were previously? I like this detail because "giant" is a more British term, whereas "titan" has Ancient Greek origin. Whether this is the new official name for the group, or if it's just a Galar-specific thing, remains to be seen.</p><br>(To be fair, SwSh didn't disband the "titan" terminology altogether. Most noticeably, Peony names the expedition "Terrible Titans... Lurking Locked Away!", but there's also the fashion designer (granted, he says he's from another region so there's an excuse; yes, I know I'm detail-obsessed) in Wyndon who makes clothes based on Eleki and Drago, and he refers to them as the Legendary titans of Galar. I suppose you could say that Peony is just going for whatever sounds more exciting.)<p>Regardless, I do like that they call them giants as well. And with Regigigas being found in the Giant's Bed, it makes me wonder if the other "Giant's ____" locations in the Tundra and the Wild Area were named after it. (Incidentally, Regigigas is always the first thing that came to my mind from the very beginning.) Furthermore, I like that we battle Regigigas in a Max Raid, truly emphasizing its "giant" qualities. <i>That</i> gives it a sense of towering imposition that it's never had before. I wonder what Regigigas's story in Galar really is.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHynrdWorKuhpJp6s7HGomVrcGFrhHZ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
