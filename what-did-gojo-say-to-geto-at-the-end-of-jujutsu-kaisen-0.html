First, why is it that, in the post-credit scene, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuta Okkotsu is chilling</a> and eating beef stew with cool whip guy Miguel or “the foreign sorcerer” (as Gojo so eloquently dubs him)? Second, what in the world did Satoru Gojo tell Suguru Geto before he killed him?</p><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=848 data-injectable=true>While the first can eventually be clarified – Yuta is training abroad with Miguel – the second never truly is, although some people know the answer. Among those who are in the know, we have Gege Akutami – obviously, he’s the one who decided to make these words a mystery – and Yuichi Nakamura, Gojo’s voice actor. That’s because, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Nakamura</a>, the words were written on the script, and he even got to say them, although “they weren’t recorded.”</p><p data-characters=580 data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true>Even if we can’t be a hundred percent sure of the last words Geto heard from his best friend, we can speculate and make educated guesses. Here’s what some fans think, before I lay out my own opinion – which some agree with – on one of the biggest mysteries in<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Jujutsu Kaisen</a>. A relevant note: my theory came after the release of the anime adaptation of the Hidden Inventory Arc and was reinforced by the release of chapter 236. If you aren’t caught up with the manga and don’t want to know what happens in chapter 236, don’t read this article’s last paragraph.</p><h2 id=h-a-bittersweet-farewell-between-two-best-buddies data-injectable=false><strong>A bittersweet farewell between two best buddies</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Design-sem-nome-35.png><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=750 data-injectable=true>On <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a Reddit thread</a> discussing the topic, one of the most upvoted comments defends that Gojo told Geto some rendition of what he told Yuta as he handed him his student ID back: “my one and only best friend.” This can certainly be it, as Geto wouldn’t have anticipated Gojo to feel the same about him after all this time and his many villainous deeds. In fact, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he says it so himself</a>: he didn’t expect Gojo to have any trust left in him.</p><p data-characters=581 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>The opening theme to the first five episodes of season 2 is “Ao no Sumika” (“Where our Blue is”) by Tatsuya Kitani. Listening to the lyrics, one cannot help but feel how the nostalgia they express perfectly applies to Gojo’s view of his past as a student at Jujutsu High. After the chorus, there’s a quote: “‘We’ll meet again, right?’ in a muted voice.” Not only is this the only direct quotation in the song, but it also adds that the voice that speaks is “muted” or “unvoiced,” like Gojo’s is when he says those last words to Geto.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=959 data-current-count=1259 data-injectable=false>This, as I’ve mentioned, is supported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chapter 236</a>. In the end, literally at the very end of the strongest special-grade sorcerer’s journey, Gojo and Geto do meet again. And they meet again as they looked like when they were teenagers, back at the peak of their youth and their friendship, and when things were so much simpler. However, it must be noted that Gojo does not react as if he knew this would happen. In fact, he makes a face and reacts quite rudely, but we can write this off as Gojo just being his Gojo self. If that wistful question was indeed what he told his friend at the end of the movie, it might’ve been because he felt these words were right even if he had no empirical evidence that meeting again would even be possible. But it was. Even if the circumstances that led to their last encounter aren’t joyous – just ask most manga-reading fans – it brings some closure, for the characters and, ultimately, for us as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6mmKefkWTEqa3TZpuinF2cvKu7jKyYsmWkpHqosdOoZJqsXam1pnnEp5tmp5Zit7a21K2qrmWblra0sc1mZ2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
