Active since 2016, So-Hee, 28, kickstarted her career as an actress in K-Pop music videos. From then on out, the actress received small cameo roles in various South Korean dramas and series, until 2020, when So-Hee landed her breakthrough role in the K-Drama The World of the Married.</p><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>Receiving nationwide acclaimed praise and accolades for her role as a young mistress in the drama, So-Hee kept expanding her influence in the South Korean acting sphere, landing several other roles in dramas, films, and music videos. Recently, the actress received praise for her role in Heavy Snow as a young teenage girl who falls in love with her childhood friend, showing the variety of feelings two girls experience in their first relationship and the difficulties as they navigate between Seoul and Gangneung.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 한소희 (@xeesoxee)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=511 data-current-count=811 data-injectable=true>The news of her involvement in Jungkook’s music video came prior to the video’s release. Fans who were already familiar with her work were immediately sent into a frenzy, while others who weren’t as knowledgeable, looked into her work more closely. In the end, the mix of So-Hee’s good looks paired with Jungkook’s music (and alluring appearance), proved to be a match made in heaven, with a hint of comedy and exasperation that comes with having the perfect duo on and off screen.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>For now, no one knows whether So-Hee will be involved in any of Jungkook’s future music videos, but we can only hope to see more of this explosive duo together.
