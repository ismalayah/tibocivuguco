Of course, with fame comes tabloid rumors and plenty of gossip, but González has managed, for the most part, to keep her love life out of the public eye. And she hopes to keep it that way for as long as possible.&nbsp;She said in&nbsp;<a href=#>Coveteur</a>&nbsp;in 2019, "But when it comes to my life and specifically to my dating life, I will probably be quiet about it. ... For me, my personal life, it's really hard as a public person, because even if you don't share stuff, there are always lies and speculation, and even more, if you don't give in, because it feeds it; it makes them mad."</p><p>Although she won't be sharing any juicy details about her love life, she has shared her dating deal-breakers. She shared on an episode of&nbsp;<a href=#>"The Kelly Clarkson Show"</a> that a potential partner who keeps their home clean is essential. She admitted that she would love a dating app telling people if someone was messy or a neat freak. González quipped, "It would be nice to know beforehand because that's a big deal-breaker for me. You know, you're in the relationship, and then you start living together, and then you're like, 'oh, wow!'" Well, if that isn't a billion-dollar idea, what is?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhkZX5yfI6tn55lpKeur7%2FFqKmmmaSevK95zp9knqGqlnqou82zmKWdqmKzs7vMZpqhoZyZtbC7w2arqGVjZ3q6scCrqmannJl8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
