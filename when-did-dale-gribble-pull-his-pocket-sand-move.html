As the voice of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dale Gribble</a>, Hardwick brought the gun-loving, chain smoking, conspiracy theorist extraordinaire to life, giving <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mike Judge</a>‘s beloved series some of its funniest and finest moments.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=559 data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true>For a man that believed Area 51 aliens had teamed up with Lee Harvey Oswald to steal his mower, self-defence wasn’t a choice for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dale</a> – it was a necessity. Dale lived every day in a dark web of conspiracy, never knowing exactly who to trust. In his mind, everyone from the Parent Teacher Association to the DMV was out to get him, and government agents were lurking round every street corner. One brilliant episode included him setting up his personal radio station, to broadcast his theories 24/7, a plan that ultimately led to his nervous breakdown.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>One of Dale’s most enduring moments from the show was the use of his creative “Pocket Sand,” a self-defence strategy that was both ingenious and effective, and has become an internet meme in the years since the episode aired.</p><h2 id=h-pocket-sand-deployed data-injectable=false>Pocket Sand deployed</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/download-93.png><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=true>In the episode “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Soldier of Misfortune</a>,” Dale’s accidental discharge at the Arlen Gun Club torpedoes his chance of re-election as its president. Dale becomes despondent, and in an effort to cheer him up, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hank</a> and his other friends decide to hire his services as a soldier of fortune (Dale had previously run an ad in the local paper for fourteen years with no responses). Hank poses as the mysterious “Mr Big,” who hires Dale for a series of straightforward missions.</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>While on Mr Big’s “mission”, Dale manages to steal a stranger’s suitcase. When the stranger attempts to recover his case, Dale deploys the famous Pocket Sand, a handheld dose of sand thrown straight to a would-be assailant’s eyes, temporarily blinding them and allowing Dale to scurry away.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>Horrified by the mistake, Hank attempts to make restitution, which causes a chain of events that culminates with him and his friends held hostage at gunpoint by “Mad Dog”, the gun club’s new president. Only Dale’s skills as a mercenary can save the day.</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>Aside from his questionable mercenary work, Dale Gribble also believed that peanuts are sentient and that the Super Bowl was pre-taped by the same people that faked the moon landing. Though <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">King of the Hill is still set to make its long-awaited return</a>, it’s hard to imagine how it could ever be the same without Johnny Hardwick and his legendary performance as Dale.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSnZJ2hlGKxorjEZp6roZKXuaZ5z66jpWWYnsBuvM6cop6sXaiur7CMpqavnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
